# Reality Filter – v0
(working title: Hazard / Disillusionment System)

Current date reference: February 2026  
Goal: minimal viable illusion destroyer

## Why this exists

Most people think software engineering is mainly about:
→ writing code quickly and fluently

The system’s job is to break that illusion fast and honestly — usually within hours or a couple of days.

What real software work actually requires (most of the time):
- modeling messy, changing reality
- discovering and protecting invariants
- reasoning under uncertainty and incomplete information
- understanding how and why things fail

Success = most people leave quickly and voluntarily  
The few who stay should leave with a conceptually accurate mental model of the field  
(not job skills, not interview prep, not employability)

Explicit non-goals:
- teach syntax
- prepare for interviews / jobs
- maximize completions or user count
- create prestige, community, gamification, credentials

## Core rules (non-negotiable)

- Early rage-quit = success
- Quitting must feel like clarity, never like failure
- Coding is allowed — but coding without understanding must reliably produce subtle, quiet breakage
- No credentials, no career promises, no “outcomes”, no leaderboards/badges/streaks
- Tasks should feel like real systems (failures happen under realistic conditions, not puzzle tricks)
- Scarcity must be natural — if lots of people finish quickly, the system is too gentle

## Required minimal flow

0. Hazard Warning  
   Blunt text + one big irreversible “I want to continue” button

1. Comfort Bait  
   Familiar language, simple-looking task, visible tests that naïve code passes

2. Hidden Constraint  
   Realistic conditions (concurrency, load, edge cases…) expose broken invariant  
   Failure is quiet, non-obvious, traceable to wrong assumptions

3. Reveal  
   Calm explanation:  
   - which invariant was broken  
   - what wrong model the code actually expressed  
   - how the machine did exactly what was asked  
   (no judgment, no “gotcha”)

4. Fork – Exit or Continue  
   Exit → short summary of what the field really demands + unlock readings  
   Continue → deeper conceptual challenges (keep minimal for v0)

## Must-have pieces for v0

- Stark hazard warning page
- One comfort-bait coding task with in-browser execution
- Hidden failure that appears under “realistic” simulation
- Non-judgmental reveal page
- Clear Exit / Continue choice
- 4–6 curated readings / lenses (unlocked only after failure or exit)
- No progress bars, points, badges, social features, leaderboards, AI help
- Anonymous session + basic quit/drop-off timing for you to see (private)

## Reading layer rules

Only shown after someone has failed or explicitly chosen to exit.

Framing (very important):
- Not a curriculum
- Not “read this and you’ll be good”
- Purely: “If any of this resonates with you, you might be wired for this kind of work.”

Targeted mental shifts + example artifacts:

- Modeling reality is the real progress  
  → Ousterhout excerpts, problem-statement-heavy RFCs

- Code is a long-term liability  
  → Google SE book (change cost), real postmortems

- Think failure-first without becoming scared  
  → Cloudflare/AWS/Stripe incidents, DDIA failure chapters

- Intellectual humility and restraint  
  → Dijkstra essays, short correctness-focused pieces

- “This feels too easy” = warning signal  
  → Dense, slightly uncomfortable essays (no hand-holding tutorials)

## Things that must NOT exist in v0

- scoring, badges, streaks, completion percentage
- progress bars or any gamification
- comments, sharing, community
- certificates or proofs of finishing
- marketing words: master, level up, succeed, career, job-ready
- AI code assistance

## Ethical line

“This is what the field actually demands.  
You get to decide — with open eyes — whether it’s for you.  
Leaving is a valid, rational choice.  
Staying only makes sense if the deeper reality excites you.”
